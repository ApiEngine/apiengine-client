WHY WE CHARGE YOU MONEY
=======================

First up, we are not in this for the money.

_So, why do you charge money?_

Money is a generally accepted record and store of value.  

We are passionate about providing you value.

Conversely we hope you will recognize the value we provide.

And that we will exceed your expectations.

_Anything else?_

We want to deliver you a fast, reliable and relevant service.

We have the skills and people to do it.

Money enables us to focus on this.

__We believe, and expect to, put in more than we take out - in everything
we do.__
