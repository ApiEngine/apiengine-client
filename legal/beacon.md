BEACON
======

We are solely focused on building an API platform for you.

We will provide you full control over your data and are adamant it is
your right to backup, export and delete ALL of your data whenever you want.

This is what we in turn expect from services we use, both in our business
and in personal matters.

We strive to earn your trust.  We will do this by acting in a trustworthy
way.  We will at times face difficult decisions and occasionally make
mistakes.  We will at times be open and accountable.

Our continued existence and ability to contribute relies on building a
financially successful API platform.  The API platform is our sole focus
for financial renumeration.  We will therefore be putting 100% of our 
effort into it.

We are just one service in a large ecosystem of services.  We aim to
contribute to this ecosystem rather than lock in or control a part of it.
Our API platform was built by developers for developers and the developer
community.  Our people have a track record of contributing.

And on contributing, our ethos is to contribute, and expect to contribue,
more than we ever take or use.

Thank you.
