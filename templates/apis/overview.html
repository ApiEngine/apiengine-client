      API Overview

    <p>The Stripe API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.

To make the Stripe API as explorable as possible, accounts have test-mode API keys as well as live-mode API keys. These keys can be active at the same time. Data created with test-mode credentials will never hit the credit card networks and will never cost anyone money.<p>
