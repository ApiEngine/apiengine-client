# ApiDocco - Beta

ApiDocco is a web app built as a tool to significantly aid your applications RESTful API development.

The goal is to build a platform that allows developers to take their API to the next level with the following planned features

Public API docs for developers and Private API docs for your own developers
Comments and notifications on individual API request
Automatically generate forms so developers can test your API on the fly!
Easily setup a mock server on ApiDoccos servers to simulate your own API
Test against your server against your API schema using the ApiDocco API
Explore other API's and enjoy a centralized API documentation format.
Check out ApiDoccos API

This is a concept mock up and will be fleshing out the most desired features from above as we go

ApiDocco's client side is open sourced and can be viewed on github. Currently it is hosted on Github Pages so what you see is what you get.
